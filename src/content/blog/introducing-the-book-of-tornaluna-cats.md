A few days ago, we wrapped up development on our latest game, **Rockstar Idol** — you can check out the details [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edo0xff/rockstar-idol-relaunch/posts/4300304).  
Right after that, we announced our next project: **The Book of Tornaluna Cats**. 🌙  

Some people thought it was an actual *book* because of the title… but no, it’s a **game**! ✨  

This time, I want to get the community more involved. I’ll be writing **devlogs** to share our progress so everyone can see what we’re working on, contribute ideas, and be part of the process even before we release a demo or alpha build.

## Synopsis 📖

> **April**, a young farmer, lives quietly in a remote area, tending to her animals and crops. One day, her peace is shattered by a loud explosion in her cornfield.  
>  
> When she investigates, she discovers a strange girl, badly injured, lying in a crater. April decides to bring her back to the farm, care for her, and help her recover — hoping the girl can one day explain who she is and where she came from.

## Gameplay 🐱

This game isn’t about action or challenge — it’s about **peace, care, and connection**.  
Take a break from the noise and look after **Tanya**, a gentle cat girl who has lost most of her memories. Help her eat, stay healthy, get cleaned up, and enjoy peaceful moments together.

Caring for Tanya also means caring for the **world around you** — feed the animals, grow crops, and gather resources from nature. Everything you do creates a calm, comforting experience — for both Tanya and you. 🌾

If you enjoy this kind of cozy, relaxing experience, follow our announcements on **Discord**! Once we reach a playable alpha, we’ll invite some community members to join a **private playtest**.

## Development Status 🛠️

Development is still in the **early stages**, but we already have the full game **designed** with extensive technical documentation. Now, it’s all about bringing those ideas to life.

On the art side, we’ve already created Tanya’s sprites and even completed a few CGs.  
Here’s a look at some early **concept drafts** (the final versions will be a surprise 😉):

We’re currently setting up the foundations — creating the project, configuring settings, and adding core features like saving and options. This part is relatively easy since we can reuse a lot of code from our previous games.

The most exciting task right now is **rigging Tanya’s sprites**!  
Rigging is like giving a character a digital skeleton so we can move individual parts easily, instead of animating each frame by hand. This makes animations smoother and more natural. Once everything’s ready, I’ll publish a devlog showing the process in detail!
