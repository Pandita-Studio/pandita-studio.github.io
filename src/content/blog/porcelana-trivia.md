Hello dear readers,

Welcome to the inaugural post of Pandita’s Blog. I would like to start this blog by sharing with you some interesting facts about our beloved game: Porcelana.

It has been a year and a half since Porcelana was released on Steam, and since then the game has received the love of all of you, the players. We are delighted that you appreciate the story we intended to tell and, as our initial goal, that it has *reached* your hearts 💖.
