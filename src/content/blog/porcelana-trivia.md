Hello, dear readers,

Welcome to the very first post of **Pandita’s Blog**! I’d like to start by sharing some fun behind-the-scenes facts about our beloved game: **Porcelana**.

It’s been a year and a half since Porcelana was released on Steam, and since then, the game has received so much love from all of you — the players. We’re delighted that you’ve connected with the story we wanted to tell and, most importantly, that it reached your hearts 💖.

Without further ado (and not too much romanticism), here are some curiosities about the game:

---

## 1. Isabella’s First Drawing

This was the very first drawing of Isabella, made long before we even thought about creating a visual novel.  
(As you can see, it’s not exactly our finest work — LOL.)

## 2. About Paul and His Insane Love for Lemons 🍋

Do you know why Paul loves lemons so much?  
First of all, it’s **not** an analogy for weed (LOL — our editor/translator actually thought it was). It’s inspired by a real-life backer who genuinely loves lemons. (You know who you are! 😄)

Speaking of Paul — that weird kid is a programmer who dropped out of Software Engineering because he got bored. He’s now tangled up in some very shady piracy deals against a powerful corporation.  

His shirt design even includes part of the original source code for Porcelana! And the method he used to track Isabella? It was based on a real WhatsApp exploit from a few years ago, where you could send someone a photo (they didn’t even need to open it) and obtain their location.

## 3. Camil 🐈

Let’s talk about Camil, the quirky redhead. Did you know that all the stories about her cats are based on real life? (Sadly, yes — LOL.)

Another interesting detail: in one of the bad endings, she wears completely different clothes from her usual light and calm colors. In that scene, her outfit and behavior are both strikingly opposite — and that’s not random or a mistake in the plot. 😉

## 4. Cats Everywhere! 🐾

Did you notice the picture in Dallen’s house? Those are actually the real-life versions of Camil’s cats — **Eli** (the white one) and **Joner** (the orange one).

And finally, do you know who the real **Pandita** is?  
*Pandita* means “little panda” in Spanish — but here’s the truth behind the name of our studio:

Yep, he’s a cat 🙀 — not an actual panda 🐼 — but his name is *Pandita*!  
Can you guess why? 🤔 Leave a comment below!

And that’s all for now! I know it’s a short post, but I’ll have more time soon to write more entries for the blog. I really want to share lots of things with you — thoughts, plans for upcoming games, curiosities, tech posts, programming insights, and everything related to video game development and Pandita Studio’s projects.

See you in the next post! ✨
