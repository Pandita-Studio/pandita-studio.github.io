## Why the Change?

It is true that our previous website served us well for many years. However, as our studio has grown and evolved, we felt it was time for a change. But the main reason for this redesign was to improve our website's performance and flexibility.

That's why we decided to leave behind our old hosting platform (Wordpress) to have more control over our website's design and functionality. This change allows us to better represent our brand and provide a more tailored experience for our visitors.

## Some Technical Details

The new website left behind Wordpress (not only the hosting but also the [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) system provided by it) and now is built using modern web technologies, including:

- **Astro**: A powerful static site generator that allows us to create fast and optimized web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps us design responsive and customizable layouts.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling us to create dynamic and interactive components.

This also represents a significant reduction in our website maintenance costs, as we no longer have to pay for Wordpress hosting services. Instead, we can host our site on more affordable platforms that support static sites.
