I’m writing to share an exciting update on the development of **The Book of Tornaluna Cats** — and some great news! Everything is ready for us to begin the **closed alpha testing phase**. 🥳

---

## A First Look at the Game 🎮

In the featured image above, you can see the **main menu**. It was designed to reflect the tranquility we want the entire game to convey — a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere — while still hinting at the **mystical aura** surrounding Tanya and the world she lives in.  

What do you think? Does it give you that feeling? ✨  

Like most story-driven games, Tornaluna Cats begins with an **introductory cutscene**. I won’t show it here — I’d rather you discover it yourselves when the time comes. So, let’s jump straight into the **main gameplay screen**:

This is where the heart of the game lies. As I’ve mentioned before, the gameplay revolves around **taking care of Tanya** — through simple, comforting interactions like talking to her, cuddling, reading together, and of course, feeding and healing her. 💖  

To prepare food and medicine, you’ll need to **gather resources**. After all, food doesn’t fall from the sky (well… sometimes it does — so why is it so expensive? 😅). You’ll have to **tend your farm**, **go fishing** at the lake, or **explore the forest** to collect ingredients and herbs. With these, you can cook meals or brew potions that help Tanya recover her health.

You can also **visit the village**, where you’ll find shops offering new ingredients, recipes, and books to read with Tanya. The **park** and the **cinema** are two other places worth visiting — they’ll feature unique gameplay mechanics that tie into the story and progression.

All of these activities — farming, gathering, fishing, or exploring — can be done **alone or together with Tanya**, as long as she trusts you enough. 🐱

## Gameplay Preview 🎥

Here’s a short video showing the current state of the game:

In short, *The Book of Tornaluna Cats* is about **caring for Tanya** while managing your **farm and daily life**.  
As she regains her health — and her memories — you’ll slowly uncover who she really is and where she came from. 🌙  

Please note that some elements are still **work-in-progress** — such as certain backgrounds, item icons, Emma’s sprite, and a few situational illustrations (like reading or exploring with Tanya). Since this is an alpha build, not everything is final yet.
