Exactly two years ago, **Porcelana** was released on Steam — two incredible years full of growth, creativity, and unforgettable moments here at **Pandita Studio**.  

Since then, a lot has happened! The development of **Rockstar Idol** is now in an advanced stage, and we hope to publish it by mid-year (or even earlier 👀). We also managed to create a small game in just nine days for the **Monarca Game Jam**!  

With so much going on, time has flown by — and suddenly, we realized it’s already been two years of Porcelana (actually three, if we count the Kickstarter campaign!). To celebrate, I’d like to share a few thoughts about the studio’s future.

## Looking Ahead 🌟

At some point, we plan to work on a **revised version of Porcelana**. Why?  
Well, before Porcelana, I had never illustrated professionally (haha). Since then, I’ve practiced almost every day, and I truly feel that my art has improved a lot. I believe I can now make meaningful visual enhancements to the game.  

That said, this hypothetical **remake** doesn’t have a date yet — there are other projects on the horizon first. After **Rockstar Idol**, we already have **three new games** scheduled to begin development **this year**.  

I can’t share all the details yet, but here’s a little sneak peek:
- 🎴 One will be a **classic visual novel**.  
- 🏰 Another will take place in a **fantasy world** with **simulation and resource management mechanics**.  
- 💞 And the third will be a **dating simulator**.  

Oh — and one of these games will feature the return of **one of our most beloved characters**. ✨

## What’s Next 🚀

Once **Rockstar Idol** is released on Steam, I’ll finally be able to reveal more details about these upcoming projects — including a promotional poster!  

For now, that’s all I wanted to share with you. To close this post, here’s a special illustration I made for this occasion:
